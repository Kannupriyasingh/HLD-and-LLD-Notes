# ðŸ“¦ Low-Level Design (LLD) â€” Notes

## ðŸ§° **Basic Notes**

### Step 1: Object Oriented Programming

* Encapsulation: hide internal state.
* Abstraction: expose only essential parts.
* Inheritance: derive new classes.
* Polymorphism: same interface, different behavior.
* SOLID principles: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP.

### Step 2: Design Patterns

* Creational: Singleton, Factory.
* Structural: Proxy, Bridge.
* Behavioral: Strategy, Observer, Command.

### Step 3: Concurrency & Thread Safety

* Thread-safe injection.
* Locking (mutex, read/write lock).
* Producer-consumer pattern.
* Avoid race conditions using synchronization.

### Step 4: UML Diagrams

* Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams.

### Step 5: APIs

* Designing REST APIs.
* Request/response modeling.
* Versioning, extensibility.
* DRY, SRP, avoiding God classes.

### Step 6: Common LLD Problems

* Tic tac toe, chess.
* Splitwise.
* Parking lot.
* Elevator system.
* Notification system.
* Food delivery.
* Movie ticket booking.
* URL shortener.
